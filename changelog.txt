1.1 - Saves Update
  Added - 
    Games can now be saved!
      As there are alot of states the game can be in when saving, so I may have missed a few button updates. These issues will simply
        graphical issues. The game will still continue correctly as all crucial values ARE being stored. But please do let me know about
        these issues on the issue tracker.
  Fixes -
    Attack Again button giving a minor error about not having a function it can call.
    Player's clock continued to tick after game over.
    Error when a player is seated in a color that is not assigned to the table.
